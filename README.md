# Comparative Study of Stress Levels and Learning Experiences in Trimester and Semester Systems

Overview:


This study explores the experiences of first-year and senior students in different academic systems — the trimester and traditional semester. By surveying stress levels, workload perceptions, and overall well-being, significant differences in stress levels were uncovered, highlighting the unique challenges of the trimester pattern. Insights from seniors provide valuable context, and the study suggests recommendations for better support, peer interaction, and holistic student well-being. This work contributes to understanding student experiences and guides improvements for a more supportive academic environment.

Objective:


The primary objective of this survey is to explore and compare the academic stress levels, learning experiences, and well-being of first-year (junior) and senior students under different academic systems.

Importance:


Understanding the impact of academic systems on students' stress levels and experiences is crucial for creating supportive learning environments. This study sheds light on the challenges faced by students and provides valuable insights for improving academic systems.

Focus on Comparison:


Our focus lies in comparing two distinct groups — the first-year students who are navigating the trimester pattern and the senior students who experienced the traditional semester system. Throughout this study, we delve into survey questions, hypothesis tests, and statistical results to uncover meaningful patterns and draw valuable conclusions.

Survey Questions:


1st Year MDS Students Questions:

Exploring the Trimester Journey: Perspectives from Junior Participants

2nd Year MDS Students Questions:

Exploring the Semester Journey: Perspectives from Senior Participants


Variables of Interest:

1.Stress Levels: Self-perceived stress levels on a scale from 1 (low stress) to 5 (high stress).

2.Learning Experience: Impact of the trimester system on the overall learning experience.

3.Peer Interaction: Role of peer interaction in managing academic stress.

4.Sleep Patterns: Impact of academic workload on sleep patterns.

Hypothesis Testing

1. Comparison of Stress Levels
Objective: Examine whether there is a significant difference in the average stress levels between first-year and senior students.

Test: Independent Two-Sample t-Test

Result: The average stress level of first-year students is greater than that of senior students.

2. Comparison of Overall Learning Experience
Objective: Investigate whether the trimester system has a statistically significant positive impact on the overall learning experience.

Test: One-Sample t-Test

Result: The overall learning experience under the trimester system is not giving a positive impact.

3. Evaluation of Peer Interaction
 
Objective: Assess the association between peer interaction and academic stress management.

Test: Chi-Squared Test for Independence

Result: There is a significant association between peer interaction and academic stress management.

4. Sleep Patterns and Academic Workload
 
Objective: Determine whether academic workload significantly affects the sleep patterns of first-year students.

Test: One-Sample Proportion Test

Result: Academic workload significantly affects sleep patterns.

Recommendations:

Adapt support systems to the specific challenges of the trimester pattern, including workshops on time management and stress reduction.
Foster enhanced peer interaction through structured initiatives to build a supportive community.
Improve feedback mechanisms and integrate extracurricular activities into the schedule.
Raise awareness about sleep hygiene amid academic pressures.

Conclusion:

The comparison of stress levels between first-year and senior students reveals a significant difference, emphasizing the unique challenges of the trimester pattern. The importance of peer interaction in managing academic stress is underscored, along with the significant impact on sleep patterns due to academic workload. Insights from senior perspectives provide valuable comparisons and reflections on challenges faced under the semester system.

Future Prospects:

Adaptive Support Systems: Tailor support systems to address the unique challenges of the trimester pattern with targeted workshops.
Fostering Peer Interaction: Focus on enhancing peer connections through structured initiatives to build a supportive community.
